                    <p>Evening is the best time to water succulents, as this is their resting time. <strong>Never mist</strong> these plants as it will cause spotting and/or rotting.</p>
                    <p>It is always better to revive a plant that has too little water than to overwater. Plants with leaves that pucker arenâ€™t getting enough water; the ones with soggy leaves are getting too much water.</p>
                    <p>If you happen to forget to water your succulents for 3+ weeks, do not worry.  At that point the plant will ration it's water until you water it.</p>
