                    <p>Succulents need bright, direct sunlight (4 to 6 hours a day), but can and will survive in bright indirect light from a southern window. </p>
                    <p>Indirect lighting will require a lot less water. When you bring home your new plant, <strong>slowly increase the amount of light it receives, since these plants were greenhouse-grown</strong>, where lighting is defused.</p>
                    <p>Without direct light shining on the plants the leaves donâ€™t get as hot and are unlikely to sunburn or show signs of too much heat.</p>
                    <p>Some succulents, such as <strong>Haworthias, prefer bright indirect sunlight all day</strong>. On the other hand most cacti can handle direct sunlight with no shade during the day.</p>
